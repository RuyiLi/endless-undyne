# endless-undyne
A fangame made for undertale (http://store.steampowered.com/app/391540/).
I started working on this project because I love undertale and Undyne is my favorite character <3
I didn't get to finish it due to homework and other stuff, but I hope one day someone can "remix" it, and/or complete it. 

This was made in pygame, a python library. Also, thanks to GIFImage by Matthew Roe (http://pygame.org/project-GIFImage-1039-.html), this was used to render Undyne.
