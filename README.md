# endless-undyne
A fangame made for Undertale (http://store.steampowered.com/app/391540/) (GET IT IT'S THE BEST).

I didn't get to finish it due to homework and other stuff, but I hope one day someone can "remix" it, and/or complete it. 

This was made in pygame, a python library. Also, thanks to GIFImage by Matthew Roe (http://pygame.org/project-GIFImage-1039-.html); this was used to render Undyne.
