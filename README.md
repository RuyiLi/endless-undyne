# endless-undyne
A fangame made for Undertale (http://store.steampowered.com/app/391540/) (GET IT IT'S THE BEST).

I didn't get to finish it due to homework and other stuff, but I hope one day someone can "remix" it, and/or complete it. 

This was made in pygame, a python library. Also, thanks to GIFImage by Matthew Roe (http://pygame.org/project-GIFImage-1039-.html); this was used to render Undyne.

If you are to remix/finish this game, please give some credit to me.

Please note that this requires pygame(http://pygame.org/hifi.html) and PIL(http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/), and of course, Python (2.7).

#Resources/Assets
I can't seem to upload the resources to github, so here's a [download link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/95g6kjg2egkbz7w/res.zip?dl=0) to a zip with all that.

#Remixing the game
1. Download GIFImage.py.
2. Download main.py.
3. Download the assets from the link above. Or if you don't want to move your eyes up, [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/95g6kjg2egkbz7w/res.zip?dl=0).
4. Create a folder called "Endless Undyne" or something like that.
5. Put GIFImage.py and main.py in "Endless Undyne".
6. Create a folder called "res" in "Endless Undyne".
7. Extract the assets to "res".
8. You're all set! If you followed the instruction correctly, you should have this:
```
Endless Undyne|
  main.py
  GIFImage.py
  res|
    blocker2.png
    arrow.png
    cage.png
    font.ttf
    spearofjustice.ogg
    undyne0.gif
```
Now go do something with this!! :D
