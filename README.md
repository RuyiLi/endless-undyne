# endless-undyne
A fangame made for Undertale (http://store.steampowered.com/app/391540/) (GET IT IT'S THE BEST).

I didn't get to finish it due to homework and other stuff, but I hope one day someone can "remix" it, and/or complete it. 

This was made in pygame, a python library. Also, thanks to GIFImage by Matthew Roe (http://pygame.org/project-GIFImage-1039-.html); this was used to render Undyne.

If you are to remix/finish this game, please give some credit to me.

Please note that this requires pygame(http://pygame.org/hifi.html) and PIL(http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/), and of course, Python (2.7).
